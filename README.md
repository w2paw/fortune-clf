# fortune-clf
classic `fortune` command replacement that uses commandLineFu.com's API

A simple exercise in python 2.x, this script uses www.CommandLineFu.com's API. 

I added some code to change some text into a different color and italics, without using anything outside the standard packages.

My experience with the command ratings is that they're largely useless, but sometimes the comments are worth reading. I've included a link to that command's webpage.
