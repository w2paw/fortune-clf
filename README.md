# fortune-clf

31aug2016 - for goodness sake, don't use this anymore. The spam is out of control and the creaters obviously don't give a damn. I was going to modify the execution to cache content, display that hint locally for mininimum delay and then fetch for the next usage. I don't think that's worthwile at this point.

classic `fortune` command replacement that uses commandLineFu.com's API

A simple exercise in python 2.x, I used the 2to3 command to convert it painlessly to python3.

I added some code to change some text into a different color and italics, without using anything outside the standard packages.

My experience with the command ratings is that they're largely useless. There seem to be downvote bots or some other reason why truely good commands get buried. Sometimes the comments are worth reading. I've included a link to that command's webpage.

Unfortunatly, it seem the site is largly abandoned, so you'll see some amount of spam, especially in comments.
